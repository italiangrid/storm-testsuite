Thanks for downloading tstorm.

To install it, make sure you have Python 2.4 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install (as root)
    python setup.py install --prefix=<path location> --install-data=<path location>

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "tstorm" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.5)
    /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)

To create binary tar.gz file, run this command:

    python setup.py bdist --format=gztar

To create rpm file, run this command:
